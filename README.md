This is the code. What I want to do is to: 

**1. EVALUATION SYSTEM DEFINTION: Generate a test set and a define function on to which evaluate different model performance:**
Let´s generate a new test set and see how the models predict them

**2. EXECUTION ROADMAP: Break down the possibilities by logic**                  
 - Automatic pandas na filling: This is what you did                 
 - Stationary modelling: I run a random forest 
 - Time series modelling: I run a Prophet modelling 
 
 
The best results I obtain are with the Random Forest. Results seem pretty good, and I believe Random Forest (Or other bagging methods) and GAM models are the best option. Furthermore, you can average or re-ensemble :)
